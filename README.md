# Schoof-algorithm
Project of developement of the Schoof algorithm for Elliptic curves cardinality. Even if there's more efficient algorithms nowadays to evaluate the number of points in a elliptic curve I choosed this one as it involves developing tools for polynomial operations. I am using this project as an exercice for C programming and overall use of Git and Github.

Please note that this project is still in its early phase of developement. Currently tools for polynomial operations are using integers for degree and coefficients. In the long run I intend to convert those types to mpz_t using GMP
